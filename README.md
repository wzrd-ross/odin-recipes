# odin-recipes

Introduction:

This project is currently designed for my first template website through the Odin Project.It's going to incorporate my knowledge of html and git, and go into my public repository.

Update 6/12: In returning to this project I'm doing more work in the odin project and now going to style this site with css and flesh out some more of the design as a study in css.
