    <p>The Reuben is a sandwich on marbled rye with corned beef and sauerkraut -- plus a few surprises! Read below for more:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>To make the Reuben you will need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Marbled Rye</li>
      <li>Corned Beef</li>
      <li>Sauerkraut</li>
      <li>Thousand Island Dressing</li>
      <li>Swiss Cheese</li>
      <li>You could mix it up with a few more things like tomatoes or pickles, but the sandwich is already perfect-- so why bother?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a lightly greased pan, add the corned beef, sauerkraut</li>
      <li>In another pan, place two slices of buttered marbled rye</li>
      <li>Once your beef and kraut have browned slightly on one side, flip to the other and place swiss cheese on top.</li>
      <li>When your cheese has melted and your bread has browned, spread thousand island dressing over the bread and and your beef and kraut.</li>
      <li>Place the entire constructed sandwich in the pan with a lid over it, then flip, one minute on each side.</li>
    </ol>
