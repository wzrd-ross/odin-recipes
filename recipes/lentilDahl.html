    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>To make a basic Lentil Dahl you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A small onion, diced</li>
        <li>One bag of red lentils(other variety work as well)</li>
        <li>Fresh Garlic, finely diced</li>
        <li>Fresh Ginger, mined or grated</li>
        <li>Garam Masala</li>
        <li>Curry Paste</li>
        <li>Coconut milk, 1 can</li>
        <li>Diced Tomatoes, fresh or canned</li>
        <li>Vegetable Broth, 1-2 cups depending on amount of lentils</li>
        <li>Warming spices, like cinnamon, clove, allspice, cumin, chilli powder, coriander</li>
        <li>Oil of your choice, I use olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a lightly oiled hot pan, add diced onion and cook until transluscent</li>
        <li>Add aromatics, garlic, ginger, garam masala, curry paste, and spices. Cook until it begins to brown</li>
        <li>Add Diced tomatoes and cook for 1 minute before adding coconut milk, broth, and lentils. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to a simmer and cover until lentils have hydrated.</li>
        <li>Simmer until lentils are tender and the consistency is stew-like. If there is excess liquid you can remove the lid and stir occsionally until reduced.</li>
